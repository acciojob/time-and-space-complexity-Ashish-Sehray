		Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm has low time complexity, meaning it executes faster even for large inputs.
	</p>
	
    <p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> is measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. It includes both temporary and permanent storage. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity uses memory that grows linearly with the input size.
