		 Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm which has low time complexity is more efficient.
	</p>
	
    <p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. It includes both temporary and permanent storage. For example, an algorithm which uses memory that grows linearly with the input size has space complexity of O(n).
