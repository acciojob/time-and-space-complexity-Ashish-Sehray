	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It is basically measures how much the algorithm is efficient. </p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> is defined as the memory required by an algorithm untill it executes completely. O(n) is a form of Big O notation, which describes the upper bound or worst-case scenario for an algorithm's resource consumption.</p>
